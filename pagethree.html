        <h3>Facial Recognition</h3> 
        <h6> This Biometric Security system is capable of identifying an individual based on facial features such as the iris. </h6>
        <h4>Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> The iris is the coloured area around the eye and a special scanner can capture these patterns and turn them into data to help with identification increase the accuracy, convenience and speed of authentication. </li>
            <li>Facial features, such as the iris have many individuating characteristics. Even more than the fingerprint! </li>

            <li>People can use special devices to change their face shape, which may be able to fool a system.</li>
            <li>The biometric security system has difficulty differentiation between identical twins.</li>
